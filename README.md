# C2KrisKurzawa-Portfolio

## Challenge 2 in MSU Bootcamp

This project is a website for my personal career as a full-stack web developer. It was created so the public can see a snapshot of my projects in one place and provide links to these projects along with links to my contact info, github page, Linkdin profile, and resume. It allows easy access to me and my work to those interested. This project sharpened my HTML and CSS toolkit. Most specifically the use of CSS variables and media queries.

## Usage

The navigation bar directs the user to each section of the page when the section is clicked on. The Resume link will display of my resume as a musician/music educator as my full-stack web developer resume is in its infancy. The images in the 'Work' section will currently direct the user to my Linkdin page as this is the first project I've created from scratch. Once I have more work to display the links will lead to those projects.
